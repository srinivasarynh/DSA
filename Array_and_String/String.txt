STRING:
In Python, a string is a sequence of Unicode characters used to represent text. Strings are a fundamental data type for handling textual information in various applications, from user input to file processing.

Key characteristics of Python strings:
> Sequence of Characters: Strings are ordered collections of characters, where each character can be accessed by its index.
> Immutability: Once a string is created, its contents cannot be changed directly. Any operation that appears to modify a string actually creates a new string with the desired changes.
> Unicode Support: Python 3 strings are inherently Unicode, allowing them to represent characters from various languages and symbol sets.
> Creation: Strings are created by enclosing characters within single quotes ('...'), double quotes ("..."), or triple quotes ('''...''' or """..."""). Triple quotes are typically used for multiline strings.

Example of string creation:
single_quoted_string = 'Hello, Python!'
double_quoted_string = "Welcome to programming"
multiline_string = """This is a
multiline string example."""

Common string operations and methods:
> Indexing and Slicing: Individual characters or substrings can be accessed using zero-based indexing and slicing (e.g., my_string[0], my_string[1:5]).
> Concatenation: Strings can be joined using the + operator.
> Repetition: Strings can be repeated using the * operator.
> Built-in Methods: Python's str class provides numerous methods for manipulating strings, such as:
  - len(): Returns the length of the string.
  - lower(), upper(), capitalize(): Change the case of characters.
  - find(), rfind(): Locate substrings.
  - replace(): Substitute substrings.
  - split(), rsplit(): Split strings into lists of substrings.
  - strip(): Remove leading/trailing whitespace.
> String Formatting: Various methods exist for embedding values into strings, including f-strings (formatted string literals), the format() method, and the older % operator.

Example of string methods and formatting:
text = "  python programming  "
print(len(text))  # Output: 22
print(text.strip())  # Output: "python programming"
print(text.upper())  # Output: "  PYTHON PROGRAMMING  "

name = "Alice"
age = 30
formatted_string = f"My name is {name} and I am {age} years old."
print(formatted_string) # Output: My name is Alice and I am 30 years old.
