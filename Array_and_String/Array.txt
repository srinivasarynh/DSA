ARRAY:
> An array is a data structure that stores a collection of elements of same type in a contiguous block of memory.
> Elements in an array are accessed using an index number, which is typically starts at 0.
> Arrays are fundamental in programming for organizing and managing multiple values using a same variable name, like a list of car names or a list of student's test score.

Points to remember:
> collection of similar data.
> contiguous memory.
> index based access.
> fixed or dynamic size.


In Python, a list is a versatile, ordered, and mutable collection of items. Lists are a fundamental data structure used to store sequences of elements, which can be of various data types(integers, strings, floats, booleans or even other lists).

Key Characteristics of Python List:
> Ordered: Elements in a list maintain a defined order based on their insertion sequence. This order allows access to elements using numerical indices.
> Mutable: Lists can be modified after creation. Elements can be added, removed, or changed.
> Allows Duplicates: A list can contain multiple instances of the same element. 
> Heterogeneous: Lists can store elements of different data types within the same list.
> Dynamic: Lists can grow or shrink in size as elements are added or removed. 

Creating Lists:
> Lists are typically created using square brackets [] and separating elements with commas.

# An empty list
my_list = []

# A list of numbers
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

# A list of strings
fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]

# A mixed-type list
mixed_list = [1, "hello", True, 3.14]

# A nested list
nested_list = [[1, 2], [3, 4]]

Accessing List Elements:
Elements are accessed using zero-based indexing within square brackets.

fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
print(fruits[0])  # Output: apple
print(fruits[2])  # Output: cherry

Modifying Lists:
> Adding Elements:
  - append(item): Adds an item to the end of the list.
  - insert(index, item): Inserts an item at a specific index.
  - extend(iterable): Appends all items from an iterable to the end of the list.

> Removing Elements:
  - remove(item): Removes the first occurrence of a specified item.
  - pop(index): Removes and returns the item at a given index (or the last item if no index is provided).
  - del list[index]: Deletes the item at a specific index.
  - clear(): Removes all items from the list.

> Changing Elements: Assign a new value to an element at a specific index.
my_list = [1, 2, 3]
my_list.append(4)  # my_list is now [1, 2, 3, 4]
my_list[0] = 10    # my_list is now [10, 2, 3, 4]

Common List Operations:
> Slicing: Extracting a portion of a list.
> Concatenation: Combining two lists using the + operator.
> Iteration: Looping through list elements using for loops.
> Sorting: Arranging elements in a specific order using sort() or sorted().
> Reversing: Reversing the order of elements using reverse().
> Membership Testing: Checking if an item exists in a list using the in operator
