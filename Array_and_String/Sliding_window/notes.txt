Sliding Window (Fixed Size) Pattern
Core Concept
The Fixed-Size Sliding Window is a technique where you maintain a window of constant size k that "slides" through an array or string from left to right. Instead of recalculating everything for each position, you:

> Initialize the window with the first k elements
> Slide by removing the leftmost element and adding the next element
> Update your result based on the current window
> Time Complexity: O(n) instead of O(n*k) for naive approaches

Template Pattern
def sliding_window_fixed(arr, k):
    # 1. Initialize window for first k elements
    window_sum = sum(arr[:k])
    result = window_sum
    
    # 2. Slide the window
    for i in range(k, len(arr)):
        # Remove leftmost element, add rightmost element
        window_sum = window_sum - arr[i - k] + arr[i]
        # Update result
        result = max(result, window_sum)
    
    return result


Key Takeaways
> When to use: Problems with "consecutive k elements", "subarray of size k", "within k distance"
> Efficiency: O(n) vs O(n*k) naive approach
> Common operations:
  - Sum: window_sum = window_sum - left + right
  - Set/Hash: Track unique elements or frequency
  - Deque: Maintain min/max in window
> Edge cases: k > len(array), k = 1, empty arrays
